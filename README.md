# Interest Rate Forecasting

Implementation of common and state-of-the-art interest rate models in C++. This project aims to act as an implementation and mathematical reference for interest rate models that build upon the basic models (Vasicek, CIR, etc.) via more complex dynamics.

## Files

## Models

### Classic Models
**Vasicek:**

**Cox-Ingress-Ross (CIR):**

### Modern Models
**Stable CIR:**

**$\alpha$-CIR**

## TODO:

- Improve mathematical formulation of current models
- Implement improvement of current model
- Test improved current model
- Write technical README
- Write intro and conclusion README
- Share

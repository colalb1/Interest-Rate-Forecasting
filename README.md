# Interest Rate Forecasting

## Ideas
- Interest rate forecasting based on historical bond yield data (Vasicek, Hull-White, CIR, state-of-the-art models)

## TODO:
- Read about interest rate modeling: why, what, and how
- Read about classical models
- Read about current models
- Implement classical models
- Test classical models
- Implement current models
- Improve mathematical formulation of current models
- Implement improvement of current model
- Test improved current model
- Write technical README
- Write intro and conclusion README
- Share

# Interest Rate Forecasting

Implementation of common and state-of-the-art interest rate models. I wanted to refresh and expand my knowledge of interest rates and challenge myself with some (relatively) complex implementations. Also want to improve my C++ OOP, organization, and guideline-following skills.

Using [this](https://www.amazon.com/Interest-Rate-Models-Practice-Inflation/dp/3540221492) as reference.

## Ideas
- Interest rate forecasting based on historical bond yield data (Vasicek, Hull-White, CIR, state-of-the-art models)

## TODO:
~~- Read about interest rate modeling: why, what, and how~~
~~- Read about classical models~~
- Implement classical models
- Test classical models
- Implement current models
  USE INTEL VTUNE TO FIND OPTIMAL LOOP BLOCKING SIZE
- Read about current models
- Improve mathematical formulation of current models
- Implement improvement of current model
- Test improved current model
- Write technical README
- Write intro and conclusion README
- Share

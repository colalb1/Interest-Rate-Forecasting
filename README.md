# Interest Rate Forecasting

Implementation of common and state-of-the-art interest rate models in C++. This project aims to act as an implementation and mathematical reference for interest rate models that build upon the basic models (Vasicek, CIR, etc.) via more complex dynamics.

## Precursor






Using [this](https://www.amazon.com/Interest-Rate-Models-Practice-Inflation/dp/3540221492) as reference.

## Ideas
- Interest rate forecasting based on historical bond yield data (Vasicek, Hull-White, CIR, state-of-the-art models)

## TODO:
~~- Read about interest rate modeling: why, what, and how~~
~~- Read about classical models~~
~~- Implement classical models~~
~~- Test classical models~~
~~- Read about current models~~
- Implement current models ($\alpha$-CIR model, pg 8 of [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07503))
- Improve mathematical formulation of current models
- Implement improvement of current model
- Test improved current model
- Write technical README
- Write intro and conclusion README
- Share
